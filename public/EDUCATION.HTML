<h4>
I hold a solid educational foundation that complements my practical web development experience. I began my journey by completing coursework in computer science and web technologies, where I learned the fundamentals of programming, software development, and internet technologies.

To further strengthen my skill set, I pursued online certifications and bootcamps focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Node.js. Platforms such as freeCodeCamp, Udemy, and Codecademy helped me gain hands-on experience through project-based learning. These programs emphasized practical application, allowing me to build real-world web applications while learning.

My education has been a continuous process of self-improvement, driven by curiosity and a passion for technology. Iâ€™ve supplemented formal learning with independent study, tech community involvement, and consistent experimentation with the latest tools and trends in web development.
