<h4>Over the past three years, I’ve worked independently and collaboratively on a variety of web development projects, ranging from static websites to full-stack web applications. My work experience has been built through real-world application of the skills gained via online training, personal study, and hands-on projects.

Front-End Development: Built responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks such as React. Applied best practices in layout, accessibility, and mobile-first design.

Back-End Development: Developed RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express. Managed databases using MongoDB and PostgreSQL, including CRUD operations and data modeling.

Project-Based Learning: Completed numerous structured projects through platforms like freeCodeCamp, Udemy, and Codecademy — including to-do apps, portfolio sites, and e-commerce interfaces — to solidify both front-end and back-end skills.

Version Control & Deployment: Utilized Git and GitHub for source control. Deployed projects using Vercel, Netlify, and Heroku.

Agile & Self-Directed Work: Practiced agile workflows and managed projects independently, improving in time management, debugging, and iterative design.

Continuous Learning: Actively engaged in self-study to stay up to date with modern frameworks, including Next.js and TypeScript.

This hands-on experience has helped me grow into a confident and resourceful developer capable of taking a project from concept to deployment.
