<h4>Hi, I'm Dax, a web developer with 3 years of hands-on experience building responsive, user-friendly websites and full-stack applications. I started with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later advanced into frameworks like React and Vue.

I’ve also worked on back-end development using Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Along the way, I’ve completed freelance projects, collaborated with teams, and deployed apps via GitHub, Vercel, and Heroku.

I’m passionate about clean code, performance, and continuous learning — currently diving deeper into TypeScript and Next.js.
